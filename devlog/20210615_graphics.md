# Graphics

## Needs

	- 2d raw: building primitives:
		- transform groups
		- stroke style, fill style, alpha; gradient; images
		- sprites and masks and sag; slicing, tiling, scaling, transforms, translate, rotate
		- paint 2d box, filled unfilled, borders, curved
		- paint paths; bezier
		- arcs; filled and so on; ellipses
		- paint 2d text; shadows etc; baselines and so on

	- 3d
		- transform groups and hierarchies
		- camera, lights, meshes, physics, retained mode scene graph
		- load assets; fonts, textures dynamically
		- gltfs

## DIY WGPU approach (july 28 2021)

	* other
		- https://github.com/tedsta/wgpu-pbr
		- https://github.com/termhn/rendy-pbr (seems to be abandoned)
		- https://github.com/three-rs/three (abandoned)

	* https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3 -> simple, no fonts but still nice
	* https://github.com/StarArawn/harmony -> also simple, author archived it in favor of bevy
	* https://github.com/rg3dengine/rg3d/blob/master/examples/scene.rs -> a bit complex
	* https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/master/wgpu/examples/framework.rs -> incomplete concepts
	* https://github.com/Joey9801/wgpu-test -> good abstractions model, fairly incomplete
	* https://github.com/BrassLion/rust-pbr/blob/master/src/main.rs -> good abstractions

	* https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu/blob/master/code/intermediate/tutorial12-camera/src/main.rs -> ok abstractions
	* winit, events, wpgu, swapchain, objects, cameras, lights shaders
	* wgpu_glyph works with the above
	- separate out camera and light? or use a different framework
	- load a gltf?

## BEVY (aug 2021)

	* https://caballerocoll.com/blog/bevy-chess-tutorial/
	* https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/res.html
	* https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/window/window_settings.rs
	* https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/latest/examples/3d/3d_scene.rs

	* I can pass my state as a resource and then pick it up again inside a bevy system (what a pain)
	* I can then order bevy to make assets on the fly; text, 3d objects and so on

	* https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/121 -> have to rebuild objs in blender to set vertex tangents
