# Graphics

I want some simple way to drive graphics.

I don't really want to be hugely invested in it - like I don't want to learn to master some weird system somebody has decided is the future of rust based programming. And I don't actually want to program the system in rust - I just want to expose it to javascript - because it's not reasonable to ask novices to program in rust - rather the way people are going to work is just to use something lighter and faster.

I strongly favor WGPU overall... what options are there here?

## Building on top of WGPU from scratch for a closer to the metal feel

It seems like every month or two I perenially am revisiting the choices. What are they right now?

This rendering example does a basic wgpu setup and render

	https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/blob/master/examples/hello-triangle/main.rs

This example also sets up wgpu and runs it - to render a 3d camera view

	https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu/blob/master/code/intermediate/tutorial12-camera/src/main.rs

This example does a basic setup and then renders fonts also

	https://github.com/hecrj/wgpu_glyph/blob/master/examples/hello.rs 

This example renders glbs but it steals the main loop … but it is pretty darn nice as a framework

	https://github.com/BrassLion/rust-pbr/blob/master/src/main.rs

https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/latest/examples/3d/3d_scene.rs

	bevy does it all… and uses the above… maybe I can add_system() to pass my message handler…
	but it is not clear how to pass variables to a system, I guess I declare a struct with some variables
	and then those become a system that gets run?
	basically I need a way to talk to bevy from the outside via messages

Or, I could build my own thing. Notably the brasslion example works hard to setup an architecture, and so does joey, and the tutorials do as well. I could scavenge between these all to devise some system. And then I could try paint something myself? This would be weeks of work however; especially dealing with input, camera transforms, shaders, asset management and so on.

## BEVY

I am trying out using bevy as a rendering layer:

It's not really designed to be used the way I am using it. There are several tensions:

- "system" -> bevy has a conceit that it itself should be your outermost scope or 'system'
- mainloop -> as a result it grabs the run loop; preventing you from doing any other work
- "resource" -> if you want to do work you have to carefully package up any state as a resource
- "system" -> bevy introduces a pile of concepts, one is a system that can "do work"
- "query" -> it's unclear exactly how a system gets arbitrary arguments but it just works

Unfortunately bevy itself is a way of thinking; and it has its own learning curve.

My approach:

- messages -> I've managed to get my message channel visible to a bevy "system" at runtime
- create -> I pass messages to my code to manufacture bevy objects as I wish
