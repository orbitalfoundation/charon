# Building on the Mac M1

I've given up on building mozjs or servo on the mac m1; there are some cross-compilation issues that I cannot figure out. I can build on x86 macs - tests are unclear about what is actually running or not. It does appear to run on x86 macs.

## Standalone build test for a piece of Mozilla Servo :

I am using this test:

	git clone https://github.com/servo/mozjs.git
	cd mozjs
	cargo build
	cargo test

## Test failure under Apple m1:

This currently fails -> it seems to want to compile for arch "arm64"? and also it pulls in many aarch64 pieces (arm64 == aarch64 -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64 -> https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/23/mac-x86-vs-arm-cpu/ -> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/building-a-universal-macos-binary ): "archive member 'Unified_cpp_js_src20.o' with length 11322432 is not mach-o or llvm bitcode for architecture arm64"

## Force Brew to x86 For Apple M1 - this does not help - useless.

I use brew for builds on the Mac - and I have an Apple M1 which the Mozilla/Servo code base is still not yet supporting.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon versus older Intel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake

This doesn't seem to make any difference to Rust - so this step may not be useful.

Uninstall Homebrew and then make a "Rosetta" terminal:

	https://osxdaily.com/2020/11/18/how-run-homebrew-x86-terminal-apple-silicon-mac/

 Then reinstall brew - trying to force it to install x86 version:

	arch -x86_64 zsh
	https://brew.sh/2020/12/01/homebrew-2.6.0/

*Alternatively* to the above you can try this if you are already using Brew under the m1:

	arch -x86_64 zsh
	There's this advice on this: https://gist.github.com/progrium/b286cd8c82ce0825b2eb3b0b3a0720a0

## Install Rust... For Apple M1 -> Rust Installation seems to force M1 - manually install a separate cross compile target.

None of the above may make any difference to Rust. If you do a default rust install after trying to force Brew to use x86 - Rust seems to install for "beta-aarch64-apple-darwin" anyway - which makese sense... but unfortunately is not what we want:

	sh <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs)

	or

	curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

	See: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html and https://rust-lang.org/tools/install 

But apparently there is a way to force cross compile builds:

	rustup add x86_64-apple-darwin	
	cargo build --target=x86_64-apple-darwin

	But this fails because the target gcc/cc is missing ... https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/666700

## Note: Super duper old Mozilla Servo MacOS-SDK dependencies

*Another* Mac issue (not related to M1) is that Mozilla seems to be building with a super duper old version of Apple XCode / SDK tools. Apparently Servo pieces are smart enough to use whatever version of MacOS-SDK you want if you supply the right hints.

	arch -x86_64 zsh
	export MACOS_SDK_PATH=$HOME/.mozbuild/macos-sdk/MacOSX10.12.sdk

	See these tips: https://github.com/servo/servo

## Note: PKG-Config?

You may have to install pkg-config (I guess clang and the like are built-in to the apple OS but pkg-config is from brew)

	brew install pkg-config

## Clang? Seems to make no difference for Apple M1.

What if I switch to Brew Clang? Can it force x86? Or does it assume aarch64?

There is soem argument to use the brew version of clang??? Some people recommend using the brew or "mainline" clang (this would seem to be the right thing I assume) - however note that the flag "--with-toolchain" was already removed a year ago so I have no idea why the documentation is saying to use it a year later:

	To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
	  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

	And after:

	If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
	  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
	For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
	  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
	  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"

## Force compiler to cross compile - can't seem to get it to do this. This fails for unclear reasons.

Perhaps you can force a target and the force paths to all the tools ()

	rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin

 	cargo build --target=x86_64-apple-darwin
